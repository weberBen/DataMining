Over Nazi-occupied France, a Royal Air Force B17 Flying Fortress becomes lost after a mission and is shot down over Paris by German flak. The crew, Sir Reginald, Peter Cunningham and Alan MacIntosh, parachutes out over the city, where they run into and are hidden by a house painter, Augustin Bouvet, and the grumbling conductor of the Op\u00e9ra National de Paris, Stanislas Lefort. Involuntarily, Lefort and Bouvet get themselves tangled up in the manhunt against the aviators led by Wehrmacht Major Achbach as they help the airmen to go back to England with the help of Resistance fighters and sympathizers.\n"}
