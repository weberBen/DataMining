He awaits his girlfriend, Lena, who does not arrive. Only a short while after this, he crosses paths with the waitress Margot, and they develop a strong friendship; Gaspard also has a fling with Sol\u00e8ne, Margot's adventure-seeking friend. Lena eventually does turn up, and by this time, Gaspard has become attached to all three women. Gaspard  is a young mathematician/musician vacationing by the seaside in Brittany, France before starting a new job. The film covers roughly three weeks in his life and introduces us to the trio of women he encounters during that time. First is Margot , a cheerful waitress who enjoys spending time with Gaspard, but isn't interested in more than a friendship. Solene  is more affectionate and sensual - she's willing to have a relationship with Gaspard if he will commit to only her. Then there's Lena , Gaspard's longtime semi-girlfriend whose ambiguous romantic attitude towards him keeps him in a state of permanent consternation. As the summer wears on, Gaspard finds himself increasingly torn between the three women, finding each the most appealing when he's with her, and recognizing that the day is fast approaching when he will have to choose. http://www.reelviews.net/movies/s/summers_tale.html\n"}
