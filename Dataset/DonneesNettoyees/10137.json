{"wikiId": "2450375", "titre": "Painted Lady", "dateSortie": "1997-12-07", "duree": "204.0", "genre": ["Crime Fiction", "Drama"], "resume": "Maggie Sheridan , a washed-up blues vocalist from the 1960s who had long since stopped performing, had settled into a comfortable life on the Dublin estate of the father of her childhood friend, Sir Charles Stafford . When Sir Charles is murdered in what appears to be a bungled robbery , Maggie is drawn into the world of illegal art trade in an effort to solve the mystery and avenge her friend's murder, donning the persona of Polish Countess Magdelena Kreschinska\u00e1. The story centers around Judith Beheading Holofernes, the masterwork of Artemisia Gentileschi, who was a 17th century female Italian painter who survived a rape. The painting fictionally travels to Dublin and New York City, and Gentileschi's tragic story eventually figures into the plot. There are other visual references to paintings in the film.\n"}
