The streets and skyscrapers that symbolized the strength and prosperity of a people have become places of horror and despair. The cultural hub of the western world is now home to only ash and blood. For the few people left alive there is only one dream \u2013 Survival. Zombies, the living dead, have taken the city. Ben  and Barbra  find themselves trapped and fighting to escape the hordes of undead that walk the streets. The film was created with a new proprietary real-time effects system nicknamed \"The Beast\", which allows the director to film the CG animations as though he were on a live set.\n"}
