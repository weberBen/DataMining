Under the care of Ann, his psychiatrist, he starts remembering trauma from his pre-coma life, including the death of his father, a break-up with his fianc\u00e9e, and a drunken binge while driving. He begins to recover from his mental breakdown, yet his delusions do not cease. As the truth unravels, he discovers that his delusions may be closer to the truth than the reality he was told of by his care-givers.\n"}
